# Headless Container Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for implementing headless containers capable of running GUI applications using Wayland, wlroots, and waypipe on RHEL-based systems.

## Guide Structure

### 1. General Implementation Guide
- Location: `docs/general/HEADLESS-CONTAINER-GUIDE.md`
- Purpose: Template for implementing headless containers in any environment
- Content:
  - Configurable parameters
  - Generic installation steps
  - Flexible implementation patterns
  - Universal troubleshooting guides

### 2. Wayland-Demo Reference Implementation
- Location: `docs/reference/WAYLAND-DEMO-GUIDE.md`
- Purpose: Concrete example of a working implementation
- Content:
  - Specific configuration values
  - Verified package versions
  - Tested environment setup
  - Working solutions to common issues

## Using These Guides

### For New Implementations
1. Start with the General Guide for overall architecture
2. Use Wayland-Demo guide as a reference for specific examples
3. Adapt configurations to your environment
4. Document variations from the reference implementation

### For Troubleshooting
1. Compare your setup with both guides
2. Reference Wayland-Demo for known working values
3. Use General Guide for systematic problem-solving
4. Document new solutions for future reference
